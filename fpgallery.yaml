  Our project is a minigame that simulates a Cornell student's coursework. 
  The terminal act as an interface for the player to enroll in a course. 
  Once they choose their course, they are then lead to a physics-based minigame, 
  filled with exam style questions. If they answer two questions right, they pass, 
  and new courses with the corresponding prerequisite will be unlocked. 
  If not, they will need to retake the course. 
  The game finished when the student complete all 8 courses in the curriculum.
